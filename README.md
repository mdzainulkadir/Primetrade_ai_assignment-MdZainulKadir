# Market Sentiment & Trading Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project explores how market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) impacts trading performance. The goal was to identify whether different emotional market regimes influence profitability, win rate, and trading behavior.

## What Was Done

* Cleaned and formatted trading and sentiment data
* Merged datasets on date
* Analyzed performance across sentiment regimes
* Studied trade frequency, win rate, and daily PnL
* Evaluated cumulative returns and drawdowns
* Explored weekday-based performance patterns

## Key Findings

* Higher profitability was observed during Fear and Extreme Fear conditions.
* Extreme Greed performed better than normal Greed.
* Increasing trade count did not consistently improve returns.
* Performance varied slightly across weekdays.

## Strategy Ideas

1. Increase exposure during high-volatility (Fear) regimes.
2. Limit overtrading and focus on higher-quality setups.

## Tools Used

Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib (Google Colab)

## Conclusion

The analysis suggests that market volatility plays a significant role in trading performance. Structuring risk exposure based on market regime may improve consistency and overall returns.
