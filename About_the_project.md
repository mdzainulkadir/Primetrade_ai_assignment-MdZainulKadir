# Trading Behavior Analysis: Sentiment-Based Performance

## How I Analyzed the Data
I took our trade data and merged it with market sentiment readings from the Fear & Greed Index. The goal was simple: see if how we trade—and how much we make—changes depending on whether the market is fearful or greedy. I grouped days into two buckets (Fear vs Greed) and compared PnL, win rates, and trading patterns. Also looked at which days of the week performed best.

## What I Found

**The Fear Edge**

Here's the thing that surprised me: we actually make more money when the market is fearful. Like, a lot more. On Fear days, average daily PnL sits around ₹5,300 compared to ₹3,300 on Greed days. That's a 60% bump. Win rates are slightly better too—36% vs 34%. So the whole "be greedy when others are fearful" thing? It actually works.

**How Behavior Shifts**

The way we trade changes with sentiment too. On Fear days, we're more selective—fewer trades, but we go bigger on each one. Mostly long, trying to catch the dip. On Greed days, it's the opposite: we're all over the place, trading more frequently but with smaller sizes, mixing longs and shorts. Less conviction, more chasing.

**The Best and Worst Days**

Tuesday's our best day—₹5,100 average. Monday's close behind at ₹4,900. Then things slide through the week: Wednesday at ₹4,300, Friday at ₹4,300, and Thursday bringing up the rear at ₹4,100. Not a huge drop, but consistent enough to notice.

**More Trades Doesn't Mean More Money**

One thing that stood out: cranking up the number of trades doesn't automatically boost profits. The big winning days actually happen in that 1,000-2,500 trade range. Beyond that, you're just spinning your wheels.

## What I'd Try Going Forward

**Lean Into Fear**
When the sentiment indicator flashes Fear or Extreme Fear, that's probably our edge. Size up—maybe 1.5x to 2x normal—and focus on longs. Take profits when things calm down and sentiment drifts back toward Neutral or Greed.

**Match Position Size to Sentiment**
Instead of trading the same way every day, why not let sentiment guide us? Bigger when it's fearful, smaller when it's greedy. Trade frequency can follow the same pattern: patient during fear, more active during greed, but with smaller bets.

**Play the Days**
Mondays and Tuesdays have been good to us. Maybe that's where we concentrate capital. Wednesdays and Thursdays? Might be worth pulling back a little. Fridays are decent but not great—selective entries only.

Bottom line: we've got a contrarian edge. The best returns come from leaning into fear, not getting swept up in greed.
